# taskPlannerProject
In this project, we developed a simple TaskPlanner application using Java Swing for the GUI. The project establishes a database connection to retrieve tasks and display them in a table within the interface. Additionally, if a task's deadline is only one day away, a notification is triggered. This date check is implemented with a simple mechanism in the code, where the system simulates a day passing every 5 seconds.

The main objective of this project was to simplify the code by applying various design and architectural patterns, which can be observed in the implementation. We used the Composite, Decorator, Strategy, and Observer design patterns, along with the MVC architectural pattern (you can explore the package structure for better organization).

Overall, this served as a simple project for the Software Design and Architecture course. Thank you in advance for your feedback!
